/*
 * History
 *
 * 2008-01-20 Holger Weiss <holger@jhweiss.de> for C99-snprintf 1.1:
 *
 * 	Fixed the detection of infinite floating point values on IRIX (and
 * 	possibly other systems) and applied another few minor cleanups.
 *
 * 2008-01-06 Holger Weiss <holger@jhweiss.de> for C99-snprintf 1.0:
 *
 * 	Added a lot of new features, fixed many bugs, and incorporated various
 * 	improvements done by Andrew Tridgell <tridge@samba.org>, Russ Allbery
 * 	<rra@stanford.edu>, Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org>, Damien Miller
 * 	<djm@mindrot.org>, and others for the Samba, INN, Wget, and OpenSSH
 * 	projects.  The additions include: support the "e", "E", "g", "G", and
 * 	"F" conversion specifiers (and use conversion style "f" or "F" for the
 * 	still unsupported "a" and "A" specifiers); support the "hh", "ll", "j",
 * 	"t", and "z" length modifiers; support the "#" flag and the (non-C99)
 * 	"'" flag; use localeconv(3) (if available) to get both the current
 * 	locale's decimal point character and the separator between groups of
 * 	digits; fix the handling of various corner cases of field width and
 * 	precision specifications; fix various floating point conversion bugs;
 * 	handle infinite and NaN floating point values; don't attempt to write to
 * 	the output buffer (which may be NULL) if a size of zero was specified;
 * 	check for integer overflow of the field width, precision, and return
 * 	values and during the floating point conversion; use the OUTCHAR() macro
 * 	instead of a function for better performance; provide asprintf(3) and
 * 	vasprintf(3) functions; add new test cases.  The replacement functions
 * 	have been renamed to use an "rpl_" prefix, the function calls in the
 * 	main project (and in this file) must be redefined accordingly for each
 * 	replacement function which is needed (by using Autoconf or other means).
 * 	Various other minor improvements have been applied and the coding style
 * 	was cleaned up for consistency.
 *
 * 2007-07-23 Holger Weiss <holger@jhweiss.de> for Mutt 1.5.13:
 *
 * 	C99 compliant snprintf(3) and vsnprintf(3) functions return the number
 * 	of characters that would have been written to a sufficiently sized
 * 	buffer (excluding the '\0').  The original code simply returned the
 * 	length of the resulting output string, so that's been fixed.
 *
 * 1998-03-05 Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org> for Mutt 0.90.8:
 *
 * 	The original code assumed that both snprintf(3) and vsnprintf(3) were
 * 	missing.  Some systems only have snprintf(3) but not vsnprintf(3), so
 * 	the code is now broken down under HAVE_SNPRINTF and HAVE_VSNPRINTF.
 *
 * 1998-01-27 Thomas Roessler <roessler@does-not-exist.org> for Mutt 0.89i:
 *
 * 	The PGP code was using unsigned hexadecimal formats.  Unfortunately,
 * 	unsigned formats simply didn't work.
 *
 * 1997-10-22 Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net> for Mutt 0.87.1:
 *
 * 	Ok, added some minimal floating point support, which means this probably
 * 	requires libm on most operating systems.  Don't yet support the exponent
 * 	(e,E) and sigfig (g,G).  Also, fmtint() was pretty badly broken, it just
 * 	wasn't being exercised in ways which showed it, so that's been fixed.
 * 	Also, formatted the code to Mutt conventions, and removed dead code left
 * 	over from the original.  Also, there is now a builtin-test, run with:
 * 	gcc -DTEST_SNPRINTF -o snprintf snprintf.c -lm && ./snprintf
 *
 * 2996-09-15 Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net> for Mutt 0.43:
 *
 * 	This was ugly.  It is still ugly.  I opted out of floating point
 * 	numbers, but the formatter understands just about everything from the
 * 	normal C string format, at least as far as I can tell from the Solaris
 * 	2.5 printf(3S) man page.
 */

/*
 * ToDo
 *
 * - Add wide character support.
 * - Add support for "%a" and "%A" conversions.
 * - Create test routines which predefine the expected results.  Our test cases
 *   usually expose bugs in system implementations rather than in ours :-)
 */

/*
 * Usage
 *
 * 1) The following preprocessor macros should be defined to 1 if the feature or
 *    file in question is available on the target system (by using Autoconf or
 *    other means), though basic functionality should be available as long as
 *    HAVE_STDARG_H and HAVE_STDLIB_H are defined correctly:
 *
 *    	HAVE_VSNPRINTF
 *    	HAVE_SNPRINTF
 *    	HAVE_VASPRINTF
 *    	HAVE_ASPRINTF
 *    	HAVE_STDARG_H
 *    	HAVE_STDDEF_H
 *    	HAVE_STDINT_H
 *    	HAVE_STDLIB_H
 *    	HAVE_INTTYPES_H
 *    	HAVE_LOCALE_H
 *    	HAVE_LOCALECONV
 *    	HAVE_LCONV_DECIMAL_POINT
 *    	HAVE_LCONV_THOUSANDS_SEP
 *    	HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE
 *    	HAVE_LONG_LONG_INT
 *    	HAVE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_INT
 *    	HAVE_INTMAX_T
 *    	HAVE_UINTMAX_T
 *    	HAVE_UINTPTR_T
 *    	HAVE_PTRDIFF_T
 *    	HAVE_VA_COPY
 *    	HAVE___VA_COPY
 *
 * 2) The calls to the functions which should be replaced must be redefined
 *    throughout the project files (by using Autoconf or other means):
 *
 *    	#define vsnprintf rpl_vsnprintf
 *    	#define snprintf rpl_snprintf
 *    	#define vasprintf rpl_vasprintf
 *    	#define asprintf rpl_asprintf
 *
 * 3) The required replacement functions should be declared in some header file
 *    included throughout the project files:
 *
 *    	#if HAVE_CONFIG_H
 *    	#include <config.h>
 *    	#endif
 *    	#if HAVE_STDARG_H
 *    	#include <stdarg.h>
 *    	#if !HAVE_VSNPRINTF
 *    	int rpl_vsnprintf(char *, size_t, const char *, va_list);
 *    	#endif
 *    	#if !HAVE_SNPRINTF
 *    	int rpl_snprintf(char *, size_t, const char *, ...);
 *    	#endif
 *    	#if !HAVE_VASPRINTF
 *    	int rpl_vasprintf(char **, const char *, va_list);
 *    	#endif
 *    	#if !HAVE_ASPRINTF
 *    	int rpl_asprintf(char **, const char *, ...);
 *    	#endif
 *    	#endif
 *
 * Autoconf macros for handling step 1 and step 2 are available at
 * <http://www.jhweiss.de/software/snprintf.html>.
